QR Code Generator using Node.js
This project is a command-line application built using Node.js that takes a user-provided URL as input, generates a QR code for that URL, and saves the generated QR code as a .png image file. Additionally, the URL is stored in a .txt file for record-keeping purposes. The project demonstrates the use of multiple npm packages and Node.js core functionality, making it an excellent showcase of practical backend development skills.

Key Features:
Interactive User Input: The application prompts the user to input a URL via the command line, making it user-friendly and interactive.
QR Code Generation: Once the URL is provided, the application uses the qr-image npm package to generate a QR code and save it as qr_img.png.
File System Operations: The user-provided URL is stored in a URL.txt file using Node.js's built-in fs module, demonstrating file handling capabilities.
Error Handling: Basic error handling is included to manage issues like missing user input or file writing errors.

Project Dependencies:
Node.js: The runtime environment used for the project.
inquirer (v9.3.6): A popular npm package used to prompt users for input in the terminal.
qr-image (v3.2.0): A package for generating QR codes in image format.
fs: The native Node.js file system module used to handle file reading and writing.

Setup and Usage:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Run npm install to install the required dependencies.

When prompted, input the desired URL.
The generated QR code will be saved as qr_img.png in the project directory, and the URL will be stored in URL.txt.

Future Enhancements:
Add support for multiple QR code formats.
Implement a web interface for easier usage.
This version expands on the projectâ€™s functionality, setup instructions, and adds potential future enhancements, providing more detail for recruiters to assess your skills.
